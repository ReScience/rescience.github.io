# Reproducible Science is good. Replicated Science is better.

ReScience C is an open-access peer-reviewed journal that targets
computational research and encourages the explicit [replication](faq) of
already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in
order to ensure that the original research is [reproducible](faq).
You can read about the ideas behind ReScience C in the article
*[Sustainable computational science: the ReScience initiative](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.142)*

To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from
other traditional scientific journals. ReScience C lives on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rescience/) where each new implementation of a
computational study is made available together with comments, explanations and
tests. Each submission takes the form of an issue that is publicly reviewed and
tested in order to guarantee that any researcher can re-use it. If you ever
replicated computational results (or failed at) from the literature in your
research, ReScience C is the perfect place to publish your new implementation.

ReScience C is collaborative and open by design. Everything can be forked and
modified. Don't hesitate to [write a submission](write), [join us](faq) and
to [become a reviewer](https://rescience.github.io/board/).
