# Editorial board

The editorial board is made of people who are committed to the open source
community and are both experienced developper and strongly familiar with the
github ecosystem. Each editorial board member is specialised in a specific
domain of Science and is proficient in several programming languages and/or
environments. We favor the Python language since it offers a powerful
[scientific stack](http://www.scipy.org) that has been proved many times to be
efficient in several domains of Science, but we also accept other open source
languages.
