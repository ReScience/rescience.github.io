<p>If your question is not answered below, please <a href="https://github.com/rescience/rescience">create an
issue</a> on GitHub and ask it there.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-help">Can I help?</h2>

<p>Yes! You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Become a reviewer by commenting on <a href="https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/issues/27">this issue</a> (see 
 <a href="https://github.com/rescience/rescience.github.io/blob/sources/04-board.md">our current list of reviewers</a>
 for the information we would like to have about you)</li>
  <li><a href="../write">Submit</a> paper for the work you’ve already replicated</li>
  <li>Spread the word about ReScience C in your community
(<a href="http://twitter.com/ReScienceEds">twitter</a>, mailing lists, blogs, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-replication-and-reproduction">What’s the difference between replication and reproduction?</h2>

<p>There is no consensus yet on what exactly these two terms mean, so
here is how we understand and use them.</p>

<p>Reproduction of a computational study means running the same
computation on the same input data, and then checking if the results
are the same, or at least “close enough” when it comes to numerical
approximations. Reproduction can be considered as software testing at
the level of a complete study.</p>

<p>Replication of a scientific study (computational or other) means
repeating a published protocol, respecting its spirit and intentions
but varying the technical details. For computational work, this would
mean using different software, running a simulation from different
initial conditions, etc. The idea is to change something that everyone
believes shouldn’t matter, and see if the scientific conclusions are
affected or not.</p>

<p>Reproduction verifies that a computation was recorded with enough
detail that it can be analyzed later or by someone else. Replication
explores which details matter for reaching a specific scientific
conclusion. A replication attempt is most useful if reproducibility
has already been verified. Otherwise, if replication fails, leads to
different conclusions, you cannot trace back the differences in the
results to the underlying code and data.</p>

<p>In the ideal world, the reproducibility of computational studies would
be checked automatically before publication. In the real world, most
published studies do not even claim to be reproducible, because the code
or the input data are not made public. Given this situation,
a Re<strong>Science</strong> C publication provides two important services: by replicating
the original work, it provides an independent implementation of the
original computational protocol, and by making this new implementation
public, it is reproducible and thus a safer basis for future research
to build on.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-the-title-prefixes-re-rp-re-and-rp-mean">What do the title prefixes <strong>Re</strong>, <strong>Rp</strong>, <strong>¬Re</strong>, and <strong>¬Rp</strong> mean?</h2>
<p>Re means replication. Rp means reproduction.
Either one can be negated in case of failure to give: ¬Re and ¬Rp.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-publication-fees">Are there any publication fees?</h2>

<p>No. ReScience C promotes open access and relies on the volunteer work of
editors and reviewers. And the free hosting by GitHub.</p>

<p>ReScience C is a <em>platinum open-access</em> journal, which means that authors do
not pay to publish and readers do not pay to read.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-submit-a-paper-using-proprietary-tools-such-as-matlab">Can I submit a paper using proprietary tools such as MATLAB?</h2>

<p>No. If we aim at replicability, we have to make sure the proposed
implementation allows anyone to re-run and understand the code without any
barriers. Proprietary software constitutes such a barrier because of their
price and their closed nature.  An implementation specifically targeting a free
alternative such as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> will be
accepted though.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-mandatory-to-have-an-open-source-license-on-the-code">Is it mandatory to have an open-source license on the code?</h2>

<p>Yes. The code accompanying ReScience C articles will be archived at
<a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> along with the article and data, entirely under
open licenses. This is part of the open access principle underlying ReScience
C. For the choice of a license for the code, we refer to the <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">the Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-submit-the-replication-of-my-own-research">Can I submit the replication of my own research?</h2>

<p>No. Mistakes in the implementation of research questions and methods are often
due to biases authors invariably have, consciously or not. One’s biases will
inevitably carry over to how one approaches a replication. Perhaps even more
importantly, we aim at the cross-fertilization of research and trying to
replicate the work of one’s peers might pave the way for a future
collaboration, or may give rise to new ideas as a result of the replication
effort.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-suggest-a-replication">Can I suggest a replication?</h2>

<p>Yes. If you want to suggest an article for a replication, just <a href="https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication/issues/new">open a new
issue</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication">call for
replication repository</a> and give the
reference of the original article and possibly the reason you would like to see
this article replicated (please refrain from suggesting your own work). Note
that you’re also encouraged to register as a reviewer such that you can review
the replication you’ve been proposing if someone actually takes up the
challenge.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for some challenge, you can also look at the <a href="https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication">current list of
suggestions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="if-my-submission-is-rejected-can-i-resubmit-it">If my submission is rejected, can I resubmit it?</h2>

<p>This depends on the reason your submission was rejected. If the original
research has already been replicated previously (in ReScience C or elsewhere),
it is unlikely we’ll consider another replication, even if you think your
implementation is better. However, if your submission has been rejected because
reviewers cannot make it run, you are encouraged to re-submit once the
identified problems have been solved.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-fail-to-replicate-a-research-result">What if I fail to replicate a research result?</h2>

<p>Some research may not be replicable. Before declaring a research result
non-replicable, we require extra caution to be taken. In addition to scrutiny
of your submission by reviewers and editors, we will contact the authors of the
original research, and issue a challenge to the ReScience C community to spot
and report (using the issue tracker) errors in your implementation.  If no
errors are found, your work will be accepted and the original research will be
declared non-replicable.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-a-preferred-implementation-language">Is there a preferred implementation language?</h2>

<p>We favor a Python implementation because this language offers a <a href="http://www.scipy.org">scientific
programming stack</a> that can handle research in many
domains of science (see for example the <a href="http://scipy2015.scipy.org">Scipy
2015</a> and <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2015/">EuroScipy
2015</a> conferences). Python is also often
reported by scientists to easier to learn and use than other languages.
Furthermore, using Python might allow us to use the
<a href="http://ipython.org">IPython</a> notebook and the upcoming
<a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> environments.</p>

<p>However, other languages or tools are acceptable if they are mainstream in the
respective domain of research.</p>

<h2 id="im-a-student-can-i-submit">I’m a student, can I submit?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes! Students are strongly encouraged to submit their work</strong>. Although the
ReScience C publishing model is a bit different from other academic journals,
it can give students a first experience at peer-reviewed scholarly publishing,
including meeting standards of scientific rigor and addressing reviewers’
comments. Publishing in ReScience C is also a way to actively contribute to
open science while adding to one’s publication record.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-know-if-my-replication-is-successful">How do I know if my replication is successful?</h2>

<p>This depends mainly on the original paper introducing the research results to
be replicated. Results might be presented in a qualitative or quantitative way
and you’ll have to clearly state why you think your implementation of a method
or protocol is a faithful replication of the original results.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-research-can-i-replicate">What kind of research can I replicate?</h2>

<p>Any computational research in any domain of science provided an
editor from the <a href="../board">Board</a> has the expertise to edit your
submission. Our editorial board is growing to increase the scientific domains
being covered. If no editor is able to edit your submission, you may
propose a guest editor (who must be willing to work with our GitHub-based
editorial processes).</p>

<h2 id="does-rescience-c-issue-dois-digital-object-identifiers">Does ReScience C issue DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)?</h2>

<p>ReScience C itself does not, but every article published in ReScience C
receives a DOI from, and is indexed by
<a href="https://zenodo.org/collection/user-rescience">Zenodo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-preferred-format-for-the-accompanying-article">What is the preferred format for the accompanying article?</h2>

<p>We prefer LaTeX using the <a href="https://github.com/rescience/template">provided
template</a> but Word or OpenOffice are
also fine if the result is comparable to the PDF produced by our template.</p>
