    <h2>Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge
    <span class="post-meta">Oct 11, 2019</span></h2>
    <p>Did you ever try to run an old code that you wrote for a scientific article you
published years ago? Did you encounter any problems? Were you successful?  We
are curious to hear your story. This is the reason why we are editing a special
issue of ReScience to collect these stories.</p>

<p>The ten years reproducibility challenge is an invitation for researchers to try
to run the code they’ve created for a scientific publication that was published
more than <strong>ten years ago</strong>. This code can be anything (statistical analysis,
numerical simulation, data processing, etc.), can be written in any language
and can address any scientific domain. The only mandatory condition to enter
the challenge is to have published a scientific article <strong>before 2010</strong>, in a
journal or a conference with proceedings, which contains results produced by
code, irrespectively of whether this code was published in some form at the
time or not.</p>

<p>Note that we do not ask you to write a new version of your old code. We ask you
instead to <strong>try to make your old code to run on modern hardware/software</strong>
(with minimal modifications) in order to check if you can obtain the exact same
results that were published at least ten years ago.</p>

<p>Sounds easy? We have good reasons to think this might be more difficult than you
think. And maybe the first problem you’ll have to solve is to find your own source
code.</p>

    <h2>ReScience (R)evolution
    <span class="post-meta">May 23, 2019</span></h2>
    <p>Four years ago, we launched ReScience, a new scientific journal aimed at
publishing the replication of existing computational research. Since ReScience
published its first article, things have been going steadily. We are still
alive, independent and without a budget. In the meantime, we have published
around 25 articles and the initial has grown from around 10 to roughly 100
members (editors and reviewers), we have advertised ReScience at several
conferences worldwide, gave some interviews, and published an article
introducing ReScience in PeerJ Computer Science. Based on our experience at
managing the journal during these four years, we thought that time was ripe for
some changes. Read our
<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3069619/files/article.pdf">editorial</a> if you want to

    <h2>Sustainable computational science: the ReScience initiative
    <span class="post-meta">Dec 18, 2017</span></h2>
    <p>We just published our white paper on ReScience in
<a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-142/">PeerJ</a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Computer science offers a large set of tools for
prototyping, writing, running, testing, validating, sharing and reproducing
results; however, computational science lags behind. In the best case, authors
may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel
confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James
Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article
about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual
scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the
result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing
journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are
hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised
in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational
research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research,
promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the
original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal,
the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional
scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation
of a computational study is made available together with comments,
explanations, and software tests.</p>
