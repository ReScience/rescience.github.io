    <h1 id="overview-of-the-submission-process">Overview of the submission process</h1>

<p>The ReScience C editorial board unites scientists who are committed to the open
source community. Each editorial board member is specialised in a specific
domain of science and is proficient in several programming languages and/or
environments. Our aim is to provide all authors with an efficient, constructive
and public editorial process.</p>

<p>Submitted entries are first considered by a member of the editorial board, who
may decide to reject the submission (mainly because it has already been
replicated and is publicly available), or assign it to two reviewers for
further review and tests. The reviewers evaluate the code and the accompanying
material in continuous interaction with the authors through the PR discussion
section. If both reviewers managed to run the code and obtain the same results
as the ones advertised in the accompanying material, and if they consider that
these results are a replication of the original work, the submission is
accepted. If any of the two reviewers cannot reproduce the results before the
deadline, the submission is rejected and authors are encouraged to resubmit an
improved version later.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-submit">How to submit?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Upload your code to a public repository
(e.g. <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>)</li>
  <li>Upload your data (if any) to a public repository
(e.g. <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>)</li>
  <li>Write the corresponding paper using the proposed
<a href="https://github.com/rescience/template">LaTeX template</a>
<strong>or</strong> your own template</li>
  <li>Fill metadata associated with your submission using the
<a href="https://github.com/rescience/template">provided template</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/rescience/submissions/issues/new/choose">Submit your paper</a></li>
  <li>Answer reviewers comments and modify your code and paper accordingly</li>
  <li>Once accepted, you will need to:
    <ul>
      <li>complete the metadata in collaboration with the editor</li>
      <li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">upload your code</a>
to Zenodo in order to get a DOI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="criteria-for-publication">Criteria for Publication</h2>

<p>To be considered for publication in ReScience C, any given submission must
satisfy the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rigorous methodology</li>
  <li>Original source code</li>
  <li>Substantial evidence for replication of the original results <strong>or</strong>
explanations why original results cannot be replicated</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, you cannot submit the replication of your own research, nor the
research of your close collaborators. We believe such restrictions will favor
the cross-fertilization of research and the spread of knowledge.</p>

<p>ReScience C accepts negative results as well, meaning here a failure to
replicate the original results. The authors of the failed replication are
expected to document their claim of failure, and to have attempted to contact
the authors of the original article.</p>

<h2 id="article-scope">Article Scope</h2>

<p>The accompanying article should help the reader ascertain if the replication was
successful and as such, the main focus should be on the replicated results and
on any obstacles encountered during the replication.</p>

<p>In many cases it can be useful to include high-level summaries of the original
model or of your source code. Your goal should be to make the article
sufficiently self-contained, but not to repeat all aspects of the original
article or your documentation. Which amount of detail is sufficient may vary
from case to case and is ultimately up to the reviewers to judge. If a reader
has to be familiar with the original article in order to understand your
explanations, consider that some readers may be unable to access it if it is
behind a paywall.</p>

<h2 id="open-access">Open Access</h2>

<p>ReScience C applies the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license to all
works it publishes. Under the CC BY license, authors retain ownership of the
copyright for their article, but authors allow anyone to download, reuse,
reprint, modify, distribute, and/or copy articles in ReScience C journal, so
long as the original authors and source are cited. No permission is required
