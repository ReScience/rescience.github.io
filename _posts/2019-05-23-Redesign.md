Four years ago, we launched ReScience, a new scientific journal aimed at
publishing the replication of existing computational research. Since ReScience
published its first article, things have been going steadily. We are still
alive, independent and without a budget. In the meantime, we have published
around 25 articles and the initial has grown from around 10 to roughly 100
members (editors and reviewers), we have advertised ReScience at several
conferences worldwide, gave some interviews, and published an article
introducing ReScience in PeerJ Computer Sience. Based on our experience at
managing the journal during these four years, we thought that time was ripe for
some changes. Read our
